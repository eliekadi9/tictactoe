ðŸ§  Project Overview

Tic Tac Toe game was developed using Java Swing, a GUI toolkit that allows the creation of window-based applications. The goal of this project was to reinforce my understanding of event-driven programming, object-oriented design, and basic game logic.

ðŸ”§ How It Works

â€¢ Players alternate turns by clicking on the grid buttons.

â€¢ The button becomes disabled after a move and displays either an X or O.

â€¢ The game checks for a win or draw condition after each move using simple logic.

â€¢ When the game ends, the status bar announces the winner or a draw.

â€¢ Clicking "Play Again" resets the board and starts a new round.

ðŸ’¡ Why This Project?

â€¢ To Practice GUI development in Java with real interaction.

â€¢Implement core game logic like turn-taking, win detection, and resets.
